# Calculator-Framework


The calculator framework, developed using the p5.touchgui library, provides a user-friendly interface for performing basic arithmetic operations. Built with a modular design, the framework allows easy customization and extension of its functionality. The calculator's layout consists of a grid of numeric buttons, basic operation buttons (addition, subtraction), and an output display area.
The framework uses p5.jsâ€™s built-in functions, as well as the p5.touchgui library for creating the buttons and handling event-driven user interactions.
Features:
- Basic mathematical operations (+, -)
- Single digit operations.
- Clean, UI design.
- Clean modular setup.
- Optimized code.
- Clear button.
